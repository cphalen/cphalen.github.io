        <header>About me</header>
        <p>I'm a 12th grader at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. I do a significant amount of work with computers and technology, but I also have a wealth of other interests &mdash; lacrosse, theatre, math, chemistry, learning Chinese, roller coasters, video games, ect. &mdash; hopefully this page will not only highlight some of my experience, but also give you a holistic depiction of who I am! (Also, you have been warned: design is not my strong suit!)</p>

                <header>Star Trek Database</header>
                <p>I took a databases course at the University of Chicago Masters in Computer Science program last year and, as my final project, I created a webstie for storing all revelant information for perhaps my favorite TV series: Star Trek! The course specialized in relational databases, so we used MySQL; although the frontend might not demonstrate this directly, there are a number of stored procedures and constraints being run in the background. I also really took advantage of Bootstrap styles (as I did on this website) to compensate for my bad sense of design!

                <header>Prep Hoops Voting Bot</header>
                <p>Last fall a basketball player from my school was selected along with 7 or so other basketball players in the state to be a part of an online pool on the Prep Hoops website. So, I decided it would be worthwhile to repurpose Selenium WebDriver, a technology I had been using at work which allows you manipulate a web browser. I was able to quickly write a script that voted for my classmate about 8-10 times a minute, and because each driver was distinct, we could vote multiple times from the same machine. Unfortunately, our tactics weren't quite enough to win our classmate the victory! But we still placed about 4000 votes and had a lot of fun. I uploaded to Python code to this address if you're curious: <a href="https://github.com/cphalen/PrepHoopsVoting">https://github.com/cphalen/PrepHoopsVoting</a></p>

                <header>Schellings Model of Housing Segregation</header>
                <p>For my final project in a Function Programming course I also took at the Univeristy of Chicago Masters in Computer Science Program, we designed an application that would model housing segregation. The application itself is really interesting to play around with, and better yet it's written in Haskell which, after this course, is a favorite language of mine. I uploaded the source code here: <a href="https://github.com/cphalen/SchellingsModel">https://github.com/cphalen/SchellingsModel</a>. If you have Haskell downloaded feel free to give it a run!</p>

                <header>Women in STEM Website</header>
                <p>In collaboration with the WiSTEM (Women in STEM) club at my school, I worked with another student to create a NodeJS website for the WiSTEM club. The website would allow users to discuss opprotunities and experiences releveant to women operating in the predominantly-male world of STEM. Our plan was to roll this website out across schools in the Chicagoland area. In the end, the club leaders decided they wanted to go in a different direction with the website, but I've included the source code here: <a href="https://github.com/cphalen/WiSTEM">https://github.com/cphalen/WiSTEM</a></p>

                <header>Student Council Website</header>
                <p>I'm in my 3rd year of operating my school's Student Council website. Working on this website has been an exercise in versatility: whenever the Student Council had a request I had to find some way to work it on the site. As of now, the website supports a system for voting that the school implements during Student Council elections, a system for class offiers to distribute information, a virtual suggestion box, and even a platform for users to sell their used books to incoming students. The website implements PHP and MySQL, take a look at <a href="https://sc.ucls.uchicago.edu">https://sc.ucls.uchicago.edu</a></p>

        <header>Activities</header>
        <p>If you're interested in what I spend my time doing when I'm not in the classroom or in the office, here's a short rundown.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <header>Lacorsse</header>
                <p>I've been a fairly serious lacrosse player since 2nd grade &mdash; that's 10+ years now! I played the sport for probably 4 years before realizing that I wanted to play the position of goalie. I think my interest in being a goalie started when my coach mentioend that it's a lot less running. What I hadn't realized at the time was that playing goalie in lacrosse is basically an open invitation to have rubber balls be thrown at you at 80 mph without altogether that much protection. I had a couple bouts where I thoguht maybe lacrosse goalie wasn't for me, but I'm really glad I stuck with it. Ever since I began high school I started playing with a fairly competitive team. The practices are held 90 minutes away from my home, but it's worth the drive to play with some of the best players in the state of Illinois. We travel nationally and try to make a name for lacrosse in the Midewst. I think easily my favorite part of the sport is plying with a group of really talanted kids who support one another on and off the field. I mean that quite literally: I've spend a lot of hours helping my teammates finish math homework and study for the ACT!</p>

                <header>Theatre</header>
                <p>Theatre isn't something people normally expect from me. I have a lot of basis in STEM in almost every faccet of my life, however the arts still hold a special place in my heart. I grew up watching my brother perform in shows, and I always just loved being in the theater. This is why I started lights crew in 6th grade. I had originally intended on acting, but I was too nervous. It took me up until junior year to actually step on stage. As an 11th grader I finally felt confident enough to perform, and I played the lead male role of Doctor Seward in Dracula. However, I don't want to undermine lights crew. If I had to pick, I would say lights crew is really what draws me to theatre. It's a trade I've had to develope over almost 6 years now, and it's something that's a really big part of my identity. I'm definitly not naturally gifted in the relam of design, but after numerous botched lighting designs and mistimed cues, I eventually found my way. Now, I'm one of the lights masters, and I am responsible for training a new generation of lights crew memebrs! All of which have quickly become more talanted than I!</p>

                <header>Movies</header>
                <p>I know this isn't quite an activity, but I don't think anyone could truly know me if they didn't have first hand experience with my passion for (both good and bad) filmmaking. I've never made my own movies, but I have always had a lot of respect for people who do. I think the medium is a really real and visceral way to protray experiences, emotions, and memories. I've collected a number of miscellaneous quotes from who-knows how many movies over the years. Some of my favorite are 2009's Star Trek when Captain Pike tells Kirk "your father was the captain of a starship for 10 minutes and saved 700 lives, I dare you to do better" or in The Immitation Game when Joan Clarke tells Allen Turing "if you wish you could have been normal... I can promise you I do not. The world is an infinitely better place precisely because you weren't." I've managed to place nerdy references to HAL 9000, Morpheus, Cobb and others all throughout my life &mdash; I simply wouldn't have it any other way!</p>

        <header>Work</header>
        <p>I would just like to underscore a few of my working experiences! I've worked with a number of really interesting people a couple of really interesting places.

                <header>Citadel, LLC</header>
                <p>I was a software engineering intern for two consecutive summers at Citadel. I worked with professionals at the firm and was given real work. In my first summer I worked 7 weeks 8am-6pm on Gloal Quantitative Strategies &mdash; this is the larger long term equities trading team. I developed software that consolidated tasks and simulations running on a number of servers and displayed data in a single dashboard. I was invited back for a second year and worked with the Core Reporting team. With Core Reporting I built software that tracked discontinuties between market and in-house historical trade data. If I were to sum up the entire experience, I think the people were the most important part. I was able to work alongside some really expert and experienced developers. They had not only a lot of wisdom to share, but were also very welcoming, humorous, and a lot of fun to work with.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <header>Starchup</header>
                <p>This was my first ever working experience. I always like to tell the the story that I was made fun of for not being able to drive! When I started working at Starchup I was 15. I spent about 10 weeks working with this 6-person company the summer after my Freshman year. There was a lot that was new to me, but I was fortunate in that I was assigned real work; I spent the majority of the summer designing an end-to-end testing suite for the company's main product. Doing real work was really a formative experience because it allowed me to really value my work for the first time. The company's product was essentailly Uber for dry cleaning, unfortuntely the company has gone under, but I am very thankful to the people there for welcoming me into the work force for the very first time. </p>

                <header>Carbonless Community</header>
                <p>I currently work as the CTO for a 3-person company called Carbonless Community. I was approached by a parent in my high school community to help promote clean energy usage. Alongside a few other high school programmers we assembled a professional-grade website advocating for green energy practices. We also wrote reverse energy auction software for low-price energy procurement. Finally we present ComeEd sales metrics in a cohesive manner (which is harder than you might expect! ComEd really doesn't want you to know how much everyone is paying for their energy!).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <header>Other</header>
                <p>I have some other intresting work experiences, mostly at startups. I currently work with a company in the insurance sector called Purple Ant that is designing IOT sensors to protect home owners. I also worked previously with a company called Waaves that was based out of University of Chicago Booth buisness school. Our mission was to make collaboration easier for music producers. We pitched the idea to professors at Booth and admitted to the New Venture Challenge. Here we made it to the final round before being cut! I learned a lot about development as always, but perhaps more importantly I learned a lot about entrepenuerism and buisness marketing.</p>
