    <p>
      I'm a second year at The University of Pennsylvania, studying Networked
      Social Systems Engineering. I'm originally from Chicago and I love working
      with computers. I also have some other interests such as &mdash; lacrosse,
      tech theater, math, and learning Chinese.

        <header>Schellings Model of Housing Segregation</header>
        <p>
          For my final project in a Function Programming course I also took at
          the Univeristy of Chicago Masters in Computer Science Program, we
          designed an application that would model housing segregation. The
          application itself is really interesting to play around with, and
          better yet it's written in Haskell which, after this course, is a
          favorite language of mine. I uploaded the source code here:
          <a href="https://github.com/cphalen/SchellingsModel"
            >https://github.com/cphalen/SchellingsModel</a

        <header>Women in STEM Website</header>
        <p>
          In collaboration with the WiSTEM (Women in STEM) club at my school, I
          worked with another student to create a NodeJS website for the WiSTEM
          club. The website would allow users to discuss opprotunities and
          experiences releveant to women operating in the predominantly-male
          world of STEM. Our plan was to roll this website out across schools in
          the Chicagoland area. In the end, the club leaders decided they wanted
          to go in a different direction with the website, but I've included the
          source code here:

        <header>Student Council Website</header>
        <p>
          I'm in my 3rd year of operating my school's Student Council website.
          Working on this website has been an exercise in versatility: whenever
          the Student Council had a request I had to find some way to work it on
          the site. As of now, the website supports a system for voting that the
          school implements during Student Council elections, a system for class
          offiers to distribute information, a virtual suggestion box, and even
          a platform for users to sell their used books to incoming students.
          The website implements PHP and MySQL, take a look at

        <header>Mathematics in LaTeX</header>
        <p>
          I'm enrolled in a topics of mathematics course at my school this year.
          Formally, we do mostly linear algebra and our plan is to continue with
          multivariable calculus in the winter. However, we also have weekly
          problem sets that are more focused on real analysis. My teacher has
          encouraged the class to write up our solutions in LaTeX &mdash; this
          way we have a digital record of all our proven theorems as well as a
          way to revise our proofs after an initial write-up. The other benefit
          is, of course, that we were introduced to the beautiful world of LaTeX
          formatting! After six or so weeks of writing up these problem sets, I
          ended up with a number of LaTeX documents chalked full of math. I've
          uploaded the whole lot here, go take a look if it piques your
          interest:

        <header>Star Trek Database</header>
        <p>
          I took a databases course at the University of Chicago Masters in
          Computer Science program junior year and, as my final project, I
          created a webstie for storing all revelant information for perhaps my
          favorite TV series: Star Trek! The course specialized in relational
          databases, so we used MySQL; although the frontend might not
          demonstrate this directly, there are a number of stored procedures and
          constraints being run in the background. I also really took advantage
          of Bootstrap styles (as I did on this website) to compensate for my
          bad sense of design! Go check out this project at

        <header>Prep Hoops Voting Bot</header>
        <p>
          Junior fall a basketball player from my school was selected along with
          7 or so other basketball players in the state to be a part of an
          online pool on the Prep Hoops website. So, I decided it would be
          worthwhile to repurpose Selenium WebDriver, a technology I had been
          using at work which allows you manipulate a web browser. I was able to
          quickly write a script that voted for my classmate about 8-10 times a
          minute, and because each driver was distinct, we could vote multiple
          times from the same machine. Unfortunately, our tactics weren't quite
          enough to win our classmate the victory! But we still placed about
          4000 votes and had a lot of fun. I uploaded to Python code to this
          address if you're curious:

        <p>
          Penn Labs is a dedicated team of designers, developers, and engineers
          who build systems to improve student life on campus. Our solutions
          help tens of thousands of students with everything from
          extracurricular exploration and campus involvement, to course planning
          and lifestyle conveniences. One major project I contribute to is a
          Python Django web-application called PennClubs that acts as a registry
          for all student organizations on campus. We completed a major suite of
          online services that allow new students to engage with on-campus
          organizations despite being unable to travel to campus due to COVID-19
          health restrictions. To read more about Penn Labs you can find us here

        <header>CIS 120 Teaching Assistant</header>
        <p>
          On-campus I work as a teaching assitant for an introductory computer
          science course called CIS 120. This is a course that I took during my
          freshman fall, and ever since I have been a TA. I teach a weekly small
          group lecture to around 20 students whose assignments and exams I am
          also responsible for grading. Additionally, I hold weekly office hours
          to meet with students and help them work through the subject material.
          Being a TA for a computer science course has been a great way to give
          back to the computer science community at Penn while also meeting lots
          of really wonderful programmers. You can read more about CIS 120 here

        <header>Blizzard Entertainment</header>
        <p>
          I spent the summer of 2020 working remotely at Blizzard Entertainment.
          During the summer, I wrote C++ code communicating with in-house
          software to build out new server features for one of our video games.
          Most notably, I helped decrease wait times for players while still
          maintaining fairness between teams. I also got to try my hand in
          making some creative decisions about player experience. This was
          another intriguing way to introduce some of the social science and
          psychology we study in my major into my work. Interning at Blizzard
          was also a really rewarding experience because I got to show up for
          work every day knowing that the products and features I was working on
          would be thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated by our players.

        <header>Citadel, LLC</header>
        <p>
          I was a software engineering intern for three consecutive summers at
          Citadel. I worked with professionals at the firm and was given real
          work. In my first summer I worked 7 weeks 8am-6pm on Gloal
          Quantitative Strategies &mdash; this is the larger long term equities
          trading team. I developed software that consolidated tasks and
          simulations running on a number of servers and displayed data in a
          single dashboard. I was invited back for a second year and worked with
          the Core Reporting team. With Core Reporting I built software that
          tracked discontinuties between market and in-house historical trade
          data. If I were to sum up the entire experience, I think the people
          were the most important part. I was able to work alongside some really
          expert and experienced developers. They had not only a lot of wisdom
          to share, but were also very welcoming, humorous, and a lot of fun to
          work with.

        <p>
          This was my first ever working experience. I always like to tell the
          the story that I was made fun of for not being able to drive! When I
          started working at Starchup I was 15. I spent about 10 weeks working
          with this 6-person company the summer after my Freshman year. There
          was a lot that was new to me, but I was fortunate in that I was
          assigned real work; I spent the majority of the summer designing an
          end-to-end testing suite for the company's main product. Doing real
          work was really a formative experience because it allowed me to really
          value my work for the first time. The company's product was
          essentailly Uber for dry cleaning, unfortuntely the company has gone
          under, but I am very thankful to the people there for welcoming me
          into the work force for the very first time.

        <p>
          I currently work as the CTO for a 3-person company called Carbonless
          Community. I was approached by a parent in my high school community to
          help promote clean energy usage. Alongside a few other high school
          programmers we assembled a professional-grade website advocating for
          green energy practices. We also wrote reverse energy auction software
          for low-price energy procurement. Finally we present ComeEd sales
          metrics in a cohesive manner (which is harder than you might expect!
          ComEd really doesn't want you to know how much everyone is paying for
          their energy!).
