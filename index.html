        <header>About me</header>
        <p>I'm a rising 12th grader at the University of Chicago Laboratory schools. I do a significant amount of work with computer science, but I have a whole wealth of other interests -- lacrosse, theater, math, writing, ect. -- hopefully this page will not only highlight my experience working in computer science, but also give any readers a wholistic depiction of who I am! (and fair warning, designed is not my strong suit!)</p>

        <p>I thought it might be fun to start with some of my current and previous projects</p>

                <header>Star Trek Database</header>
                <p>My final project in a Databases course I took at the University of Chicago Masters in Computer Science program I created a webstie capable of storing all information relevant to one of my favorite TV series: Star Trek! The course specialized in relational databases, so we used MySQL and although the frontend might not demonstrate, there are a number of stored procedures and constraints being run in the background. I also really took advantage of Bootstrap styles to compensate for my bad sense of design! Go check out this project at <a href="http://mpcs53001.cs.uchicago.edu/~cphalen">https://mpcs53001.cs.uchicago.edu/~cphalen</a></p>

                <header>Student Council Website</header>
                <p>I'm coming up on my 3rd year of operating my school's Student Council website. Working on this website has been an exercise in versatility, whenever the Student Council had a request I had to find some way to work it into the site. As of now, the website supports a system for voting that the school implements during class elections, a system for class offiers to distribute information, a virtual suggestion box, and even a platform for users to sell their used books to incoming students. The website implements PHP and MySQL, take a look at <a href="https://sc.ucls.uchicago.edu">https://sc.ucls.uchicago.edu</a></p>

                <header>Women in STEM Website</header>
                <p>In collaboration with the WiSTEM (Women in STEM) club at my school, I worked with another student to create a NodeJS website for the WiSTEM club. The website woudl allow users to discuss opprotunities and experience, as well as communicate with the club leaders. Our plan was to roll this website out across schools in the Chicagoland area. Unfortunately, the club leaders decided they wanted to go in a different direction with the website, but I've included the source code here: <a href="https://github.com/cphalen/WiSTEM">https://github.com/cphalen/WiSTEM</a></p>

                <header>Prep Hoops Voting Bot</header>
                <p>This fall a basketball player from my school was selected along with 7 or so other basketball players in the state to be a part of an online pool on the Prep Hoops website. So, I decided it would be worthwhile to repurpose Selenium WebDriver, a technology I had been using at work that allows you manipulate a web browser. I was able to quickly write a script that voted for my classmate about 8-10 times a minute, and each driver was distinct so we could vote multiple times from the same machine. Unfortunately, our tactics weren't quite enough to win our classmate the victory! But we still had a little bit of fun. I uploaded to Python code to this address if you're curious: <a href="https://github.com/cphalen/PrepHoopsVoting">https://github.com/cphalen/PrepHoopsVoting</a></p>

                <header>Schellings Model of Housing Segregation</header>
                <p>For my final project in a Function Programming course I also took at the Univeristy of Chicago Masters in Computer Science Program, we designed an application that would model housing segregation. The application itself is really interesting to play around with, and the source code I think is awesome it's written in Haskell which, after thsi course, is a favorite language of mine. I uploaded the source code here: <a href="https://github.com/cphalen/SchellingsModel">https://github.com/cphalen/SchellingsModel</a>. If you have Haskell downloaded feel free to give it a run!</p>
